Diagnosing and Resolving Cloud Platform Instability with Multi-modal RAG LLMs

# Description
Todayâ€™s cloud-hosted applications and services
are complex systems, and a performance or func-
tional instability can have dozens or hundreds of
potential root-causes. Our hypothesis is that the
pattern matching capabilities of modern AI tools,
combined with a natural multimodal RAG LLM
interface, could simplify problem identification
and resolution. ARCA is a new multimodal RAG
LLM system targeting this domain.
